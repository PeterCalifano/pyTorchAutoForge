## Planned changelog for next releases

- [x] v0.1.3

- [ ] v0.1.4
  - [x] Add prototype implementation of heads and backbones builders using registries
  - [ ] Add abstract meta class for loss functions to enforce interface
  - [ ] Add prototype implementation of dataset classes from RAM/disk
  - [ ] Fix all unit tests
  - [x] Complete 1st version of model profiler
  - [x] Add prototype of model explainer for vector-to-vector regression using SHAP (basic explainer)
  - [x] Add refactored version of augmentation pipeline (ImagesAugmentationHelper)
  - [x] Refactor and improve ModelTrainingManager updating augmentation pipeline and adding batch accumulation

- [ ] v0.2.0
  - [ ] All those above
  - [ ] Add working argument parser for training scripts
  - [ ] Add configurable dataclasses from template yml files
  - [ ] Add prototype version of model hyperparams optim tuning with default params to search (scheduler, its parameters, batch size, num of epochs, what else?)
  - [ ] Add prototype of model explainer for image to vector regression using Captum

## Modules development notes (to allocate)

### Library management and config

- [x] Review linters/code formatting tools and configure them properly to comply with standards
