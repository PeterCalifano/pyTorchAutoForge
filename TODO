- Patches of v0.2.X
  - [x] Major fixes in v0.2.1 (bugs introduced in v0.2.0)

- [ ] v0.3.X
  - [ ] Implement custom adaptive pooling layers for ONNx static export 
  - [ ] Implement tests for *onnxability* of models provided by model_building module of PTAF
  - [ ] Modify implementation of trainer to use static or cls methods instead of instance methods for increased flexibility
  - [ ] Add capability to trainer/new class helper: transfer learning from checkpoint instead of replacing model!
  - [ ] Fix unit tests
  - [ ] Implement export method (traced, onnx, model pth) in ModelTrainingManager
  - [ ] Add abstract meta class for loss functions to enforce interface
  - [ ] Review checkpoint resuming code (ensure the checkpoint is loaded correctly) and add evaluation before training (baseline score)
  - [ ] Upgrade PTAF trainer and loss function interfaces to support image segmentation tasks
  - [ ] Add batched bbox label generator using binary thresholded mask/image
  - [ ] Modify DataLoaderIndex to accept datasets directly and a combination of datasets and dataloaders. If dataset is input, use default specifications for dataloader
  - [ ] Implement new training mode: SWA_MODE
  - [ ] Add pruning strategy in NORMAL MODE using "delta loss" over patience interval to check for pruning (like OPTUNA)
  - [ ] Implement prototype usage of AMP for mixed precision training
  - [ ] Add configurable dataclasses from template yml files for training manager and extensible prototype (see pySR configuration in nav-frontend)
  - [ ] Add pySR conveniency module
  - [ ] Explore Hydra for configuration management from yml files
  - [ ] Add prototype of SHAP for CNNs
  - [ ] Add prototype of model explainer for vector-to-vector regression using Captum (2 methods)
  - [ ] Upgrade api.torch to save model "packages" with all info to run the model
  - [ ] Improve docstrings in src code

- v0.X.X
  - [ ] Implement prototype of K-fold cross-validation for training runs
  - [ ] Extend ModelEvaluator to evaluate sklearn and xgb models
  - [ ] All those above
  - [ ] Add working argument parser for training scripts
  - [ ] Add configurable dataclasses from template yml files
  - [ ] Add prototype version of model hyperparams optim tuning with default params to search (scheduler, its parameters, batch size, num of epochs, what else?)
  - [ ] Add prototype of model explainer for image to vector regression using Captum
  - [ ] Rework ModelTrainingManager to avoid inheritance of configuration

## Modules development notes (to allocate)

### Library management and config

- [x] Review linters/code formatting tools and configure them properly to comply with standards

- [ ] Add type annotations for mypy

- [ ] Automate documentation building process

- [x] Implement CI/CD to run tests

- [x] Configure project to use hatch build for automatic versioning linked to git tags

### Evaluation

- [ ]

### Optimization

- [ ]

### API module

- [ ] Add prototype implementation of mlflow api: MlflowHandler to replace manually written code in optimization module
- [ ] Add prototype implementation of telegram bot api for training push notifications
